## data set 
- there is some time that the data doesn't have the same length, but I was unable to find the reason for that. -> Thus made a sanity check to loop through the data and check if the length is the same.

When evaluating, there is also possibility of not getting the data in correct format. Thus I need a clever way to record the iteration and the data that is not in correct format.

- ALthough silu, but when looked in detiail, it is still a swiGLU but integrated into the MLP layer.
